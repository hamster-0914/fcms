My final year project is a Forensic Case Management System (FCMS). It is developed using Django and MySQL and is integrated with a simple self made blockchain. The purpose of the system is to assist forensic practitioners such as forensic investigators, chemists and forensic pathologists in efficiently managing and organising information register to forensic cases.
